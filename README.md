# NotifiVR

A Unity framework to allow you to display notifications from an outside source inside your VR environments. Made at Georgia Tech under the UbiComp lab.

Currently, the framework requires an outside app or stimuli to process in order to trigger displaying the notifications. This frameowrk does not contain that app, only the triggers required in Unity.
